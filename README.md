# ChinookNewItunes
This is the fifth project in Experis academy, where we created a superhero-themed database using SQL scripts and a console application in C#. The project was completed in pairs using pair programming methodology. Our development environment consisted of Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 6 and SQL Server Management Studio.

The project required us to create SQL scripts to build the database, create tables, establish relationships, and populate tables with data. In addition, we implemented repository functionality using C# in the console application to access data from the Chinook database.

Functionalities included in the C# application are as follows:

- Retrieve a list of all customers in the database and display their ID, first name, last name, country, postal code, phone number, and email.
- Retrieve the details of a customer with a specific ID from the database and display the same fields as above.
- Retrieve the details of a customer with a specific name from the database using partial matching with the LIKE keyword.
- Retrieve a subset of customers from the database based on a specified limit and offset using the SQL LIMIT and OFFSET keywords.
- Add a new customer to the database, including the fields listed above.
- Update the details of an existing customer in the database.
- Retrieve the number of customers in each country, ordered in descending order by the count.
- Retrieve a list of customers who have spent the most money on purchases in descending order of total spending.
  Given a customer, retrieve their most popular genre based on the number of tracks associated with each genre in their purchase history. In case of a tie, display all tied genres.
